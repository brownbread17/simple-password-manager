# simple-password-manager
A simple password manager which generates passwords and stores it along with website name and username
A random password is generated from a string which contains both upper case and lower case letters along with numbers and speccial characters. The program asks the user whether he/she wants to save it, if yes, then the program asks for the website name and username of the site for which the password was stored for.
The user can easily find the password by entering the website name for which he wants the password in the find password program.
In no way this is a complete project and any suggestions are welcome.
